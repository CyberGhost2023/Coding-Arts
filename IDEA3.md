# Phase 2 Questions

## Problem Statement 7:
There will be a sports competition on this upcoming Republic day in Ravi's school. There will be a lot of different sports available for participating. But Ravi is more inclined towards the one which requires a team to participate.

For this year Ravi has been appointed as the referee of two particular sports named duo relay race & trio relay race.

To make the races more optimal and neutral the school authority has come up with an idea of equivalent team distribution. The teams will be created with student of same height only.

For an example, if the students of a particular class having heights as = {160,170,180,160,170,180}

Then team A will be of students with height 160, team B will be of students with height 170 and so on. Given that, height of a team will be unique among all the teams.
But the main problem arises when a student’s height matches with no one, as a result he/she can’t participate.

As a referee Ravi has to find this type of students so that he can take special care of them.
Can you help Ravi?

N.B: Trio relay race consists a team of three same height players and Duo relay race consists a team of two same height players.
It is always true that there will always be only one student whose height will match with no one.


n - number of students in duo race
m - number of students in trio race
