/* 
   Let 'V' be the total number of cities in the map connected in the form of a graph and 
       'E' be the number of prerequisite connections (accepted as input starting from second line of input)
    
   Time Complexity: O(V+E) -> owing to the use of topological sort.
   Space Complexity: O(V+E) -> space requirement for storing the locations(V) and number of edges/prerequisite (E). 
                     O(V) -> auxiliary space to store indegree of each nodes
                     O(V) -> to store the nodes in the order they are finally visited
                     O(V) -> auxiliary space to store visited nodes while performing topological sort 
                     Therefore, the overall Space Complexity is O(V+E)
                     
Note - Space Complexity would be O((V+E)*|S|), if we consider that using string as key/value also takes some space equal to length of string.
